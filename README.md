#Variation of the Three Sum Problem. 

The program finds all distinct triplets that sum to 0 within the list and times 3 different algorithms to solve the problem. Input list is random for each N.

The algorithms run in

1. n3 cubic time - duplicates
2. n2*log(n) - duplicates
3. n2 - no duplicates

TO BUILD:

1. Download and unzip the zip file, click green code button in the right corner.
2. Source files are located within Lab0x04_TripletSum folder (main.cpp , utils.hpp, utils.cpp)
3. Build the 2 source files
    g++ -o program main.cpp utils.cpp
4. Run the executable
